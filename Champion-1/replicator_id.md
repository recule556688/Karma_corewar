Name: The Replicator (*Master of Duplication*)
Logo: (Optional)

Strength: A dual-strategy champion that combines aggressive replication with systematic bombing. Uses a simple but effective approach with three main processes running simultaneously.

Strategy: This champion operates with three concurrent processes:
1. **Main Fork Controller**: Continuously spawns bomber and replicator processes to maintain pressure
2. **Bomber Process**: Systematically places bombs across the arena using a step size of 17 positions to create unpredictable attack patterns
3. **Replicator Process**: Aggressively forks itself to create an exponentially growing army of processes

The step size of 17 (a prime number) ensures the bombing pattern doesn't fall into predictable cycles, making it harder for enemies to avoid.

Weakness: Simple strategy makes it vulnerable to sophisticated scanners. The replication can be countered by quick elimination of fork points, and the bombing pattern, while using a prime step, is still mathematically predictable.
