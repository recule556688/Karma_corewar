Name: The Parasite (*Process Hijacker*)
Logo: (Optional)

Strength: A champion that hijacks and controls opponent processes. Uses three specialized processes:
1. Hijacker: Takes control of opponent processes using OR operations with prime numbers (37, 61)
2. Controller: Maintains control using AND operations with prime numbers (67, 71)
3. Spreader: Creates multiple infection points

Strategy: This champion uses process hijacking to turn opponent processes against them. The combination of OR and AND operations with large prime numbers makes it extremely effective at taking control.

Weakness: Requires opponent processes to be active to be effective.
