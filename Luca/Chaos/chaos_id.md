Name: The Chaos (*Memory Corruptor*)
Logo: (Optional)

Strength: An extremely aggressive champion that combines memory corruption with process flooding. Uses three complementary processes:
1. Corruptor: Corrupts memory using XOR operations with prime numbers (47, 53)
2. Flooder: Creates an exponential number of processes
3. Chaos Engine: Creates unpredictable memory states

Strategy: This champion uses large prime numbers and multiple forking processes to overwhelm the opponent. The combination of memory corruption and process flooding makes it extremely difficult to counter.

Weakness: High resource usage might slow down the virtual machine.
