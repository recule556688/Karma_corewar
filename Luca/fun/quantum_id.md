Name: The Quantum (*Master of Superposition*)
Logo: (Optional)

Strength: A unique champion that uses quantum-like behavior with superposition and entanglement. Features:
1. A superposition process that creates multiple states simultaneously
2. An entanglement process that links different memory locations

Strategy: This champion uses prime numbers (29 and 23) for its quantum patterns. It creates unpredictable states through XOR operations and maintains connections through AND operations, making it extremely hard to track and eliminate.

Weakness: Complex behavior can sometimes lead to self-interference.
