Name: The Replicator (*Master of Duplication*)
Logo: (Optional)

Strength: Combines replication with bombing strategy. Creates multiple copies of itself while simultaneously bombing the arena with destructive code.

Strategy: This champion uses a dual-role approach:
1. One process continuously replicates itself to ensure survival
2. Another process systematically bombs the arena using a prime number (17) as step size to avoid predictable patterns

Weakness: Vulnerable to quick scanners that can detect and eliminate the replication point.
