Name: The Time Bomb (*Master of Delayed Destruction*)
Logo: (Optional)

Strength: Uses a unique timing mechanism to plant delayed bombs. The champion operates in two phases:
1. A bomb planter that systematically places bombs
2. A timer that triggers explosions at precise intervals

Strategy: This champion uses prime numbers (31 and 7) for its timing patterns to create unpredictable explosions. The combination of immediate and delayed bombs makes it hard to defend against.

Weakness: Vulnerable to quick scanners that can detect and defuse the bombs before they explode.
