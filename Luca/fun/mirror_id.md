Name: The Mirror (*Reflection Master*)
Logo: (Optional)
USE
Strength: A unique champion that reflects and amplifies opponent attacks. Uses two complementary processes:
1. A reflector that copies and redirects opponent code
2. An amplifier that doubles the power of reflected attacks

Strategy: This champion uses prime numbers (13 and 11) for its reflection patterns. Instead of attacking directly, it turns the opponent's strength against them by reflecting and amplifying their attacks.

Weakness: Less effective against passive opponents that don't attack.
