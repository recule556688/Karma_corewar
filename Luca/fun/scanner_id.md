Name: The Scanner (*Precision Hunter*)
Logo: (Optional)

Strength: Specializes in finding and eliminating targets with high precision. Uses a prime number (19) as step size to avoid pattern detection.

Strategy: This champion employs a systematic scanning approach:
1. Scans memory using a non-predictable pattern
2. When a target is found, immediately eliminates it
3. Continues scanning while staying alive through live instructions

Weakness: Can be overwhelmed by rapid replication or multiple targets.
