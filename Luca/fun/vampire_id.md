Name: The Vampire (*Process Parasite*)
Logo: (Optional)

Strength: Infects and controls other processes while maintaining its own survival. Uses a prime number (23) as step size for infection spread.

Strategy: This champion uses a parasitic approach:
1. Continuously infects memory locations with its code
2. Creates multiple infection points through forking
3. Maintains survival through live instructions and replication

Weakness: Can be detected and eliminated by scanners before establishing multiple infection points.
