Name: The Annihilator (*Memory Destroyer*)
Logo: (Optional)

Strength: A champion that uses extreme memory manipulation. Features three devastating processes:
1. Destroyer: Corrupts memory using XOR operations with large prime numbers (79, 83)
2. Manipulator: Alters memory states using AND operations with prime numbers (89, 97)
3. Annihilator: Creates multiple destruction points

Strategy: This champion uses extremely large prime numbers and aggressive memory manipulation to destroy opponent code. The combination of XOR and AND operations with multiple forking processes makes it nearly impossible to defend against.

Weakness: May cause system slowdown due to extreme memory manipulation.
