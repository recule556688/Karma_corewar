Logo: (Optional)

Strength: An advanced champion implementing quantum-inspired computational strategies through sophisticated bitwise operations. Features three specialized quantum-like processes working in harmony.

Strategy: This champion uses quantum computing concepts translated to Corewar:
1. **Superposition Process**: Creates multiple states using XOR operations with dynamic step patterns (base 23, factors 13, 7), simulating quantum superposition
2. **Quantum Shield**: Employs OR operations with step size 19 to create protective quantum barriers, representing quantum entanglement effects
3. **Quantum Tunnel**: Uses AND operations with step size 17 to create tunneling effects, allowing penetration through enemy defenses

The combination of XOR, OR, and AND operations with prime step sizes (23, 19, 17) creates complex interference patterns that are extremely difficult to predict or counter.

Weakness: The quantum-like behavior, while sophisticated, can occasionally create self-interference patterns that may disrupt its own operations. The complexity requires careful synchronization between processes.
