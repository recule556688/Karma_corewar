Name: The Time Bomb (*Master of Complex Warfare*)
Logo: (Optional)

Strength: A sophisticated multi-process champion featuring advanced timing mechanisms, self-repair capabilities, and defensive strategies. Operates with four distinct tactical processes.

Strategy: This champion employs a complex four-pronged approach:
1. **Bomb Planter**: Places bombs using a dynamic step pattern (base 23) with XOR mutations and additional randomization (factors 13, 7)
2. **Timer System**: Implements a secondary timing mechanism with step size 5, providing delayed activation sequences
3. **Self-Repair Module**: Monitors and repairs critical code sections using step size 17, ensuring long-term survival
4. **Defensive Perimeter**: Actively defends key positions using step size 23, creating protective barriers

The combination of XOR operations and multiple prime number steps (23, 13, 7, 17, 5) creates highly unpredictable patterns.

Weakness: High complexity can lead to resource overhead. Multiple processes competing for execution cycles may slow response time to immediate threats.
